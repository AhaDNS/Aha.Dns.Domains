# Aha.Domains

Official white- and black-list for [AhaDNS](https://ahadns.com).

## Intended usecase

Used by all AhaDNS DNS servers. Exactly how these lists are used can be seen in the [local script](https://github.com/AhaDNS/dns-server-setup/blob/main/files/scripts/bash/unbound_update.sh) installed on all our DNS servers.
